# SystemInfo

This was a take home assignment I was given for a job search.  I was invited to showcase my macOS development skills by writing a simple macOS System Utility Application that displays, at minimum:

* Current CPU Usage:
  * Utilize low-level Darwin API code for precise CPU activity calculations.
  * Ensure real-time updates in the UI
* Memory:
  * Display total available and used memory.
* Disk space availability:
  * Present a basic graph illustrating available space for all connected volumes (exclude system volumes).
* User Interface:
  * Maintain a clean, organized and modern aesthetic, avoiding reliance soley on text elements.
 
### Guidelines
* You may use only native libraries / frameworks included in macOS -- no command line tools, open source, or other ready-made solutions.
* Swift should be the primary language.
* Please spend no more than 3-4 hours on this assigment
